NetGuard AI is a full-stack, AI-powered Threat Modeling Sandbox designed for modern security teams. It leverages generative AI (powered by Google's Genkit) to provide a dynamic, interactive "purple team" experience, allowing users to safely simulate, analyze, and defend against complex cloud-native attacks.

**Key Features:**

*   **AI-Powered Scenario Generation:** Users can describe an attack in plain English, and the AI will generate a realistic, simulated attack script targeting cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).

*   **Dynamic Threat Modeling:** The sandbox analyzes the generated script to model its full impact, producing a rich dataset including security events, a professional threat analysis with a risk score, and a list of affected cloud resources.

*   **Automated Defense & Engagement Analysis:** The AI not only generates a defensive countermeasure script but also simulates an engagement between the attack and defense, providing a detailed interaction log and a quantitative "Effectiveness Score" to validate the response strategy.

NetGuard AI moves beyond static analysis, offering an interactive training ground for security professionals to proactively test playbooks, understand novel attack vectors, and strengthen their defenses in a controlled, AI-driven environment.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Google Genkit, Google AI Platform.
