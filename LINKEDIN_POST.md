Thrilled to share my latest project: **NetGuard AI**, an AI-powered Threat Modeling Sandbox! 🛡️🤖

In cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats means thinking like an attacker. But how do you safely test your defenses against novel, complex attacks?

NetGuard AI is my answer. It's a full-stack Next.js application that uses generative AI (powered by Google's Genkit) to create a dynamic "purple team" experience.

Here’s how it works:
1.  **Describe an attack** in plain English. The AI generates a simulated attack script.
2.  **Run the script** in the sandbox. The AI models the entire attack, generating security events, identifying affected cloud resources, and creating a professional threat analysis.
3.  **Get a defense!** The AI writes a countermeasure script and then tests it against the original attack, giving you an effectiveness score and a step-by-step interaction log.

This isn't just a static analysis tool; it's an interactive training ground for security professionals to understand attack vectors and validate their response strategies in a controlled environment.
