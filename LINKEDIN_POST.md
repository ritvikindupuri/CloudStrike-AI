A full-stack, AI-powered Threat Modeling Sandbox designed for modern security teams. CloudStrike AI provides a dynamic, interactive "purple team" experience, allowing users to safely simulate, analyze, and defend against complex cloud-native attacks.

**Key Contributions & Features:**

*   **AI Core Development:** Engineered a multi-agent AI core with Google's Genkit to autonomously generate attack scripts from natural language, model complex threat scenarios, and create/validate defensive countermeasures.

*   **Dynamic Threat Modeling:** Developed the core analysis engine which, when given a script, models its full impact to produce a rich dataset including security events, a professional threat analysis with a risk score, and a list of affected cloud resources.

*   **Automated Defense & Improvement:** Implemented a unique engagement simulation where the AI not only generates a defense script but also pits it against the attack, providing a detailed interaction log, a quantitative "Effectiveness Score," and an **automatically improved version of the countermeasure** to validate and harden the response.

*   **Full-Stack Implementation:** Built the entire user-facing application using Next.js, React, and TypeScript, with a responsive and professional UI crafted from ShadCN components, Recharts, and Tailwind CSS.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Google Genkit, Google AI Platform.
