- Architected and developed NetGuard AI, a full-stack threat modeling sandbox for proactive cloud security, enabling teams to simulate and analyze attacks on AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.

- Engineered a multi-agent AI system with Google Genkit to autonomously model threats; the AI analyzes attack scripts to generate a detailed impact assessment, a 100-point risk score, and validates countermeasures with a quantifiable effectiveness score.

- Implemented a dynamic front-end with Next.js and React to present complex, AI-generated security data, including interactive dashboards, sortable event logs, and automated incident response playbooks for immediate action.
