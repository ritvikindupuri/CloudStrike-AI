## CloudStrike AI

- Architected and developed CloudStrike AI, a full-stack threat modeling sandbox for proactive cloud security, enabling teams to simulate and analyze attacks on AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.
- Engineered a multi-agent Genkit AI that quantifies attack severity, assigns a risk score to simulated threats, and validates defensive scripts with a quantifiable effectiveness score before **iteratively improving the defense** to measure mitigation success.
- Developed a dynamic Next.js and React front-end to visualize complex, AI-generated threat data, featuring interactive dashboards, sortable event logs, persistent session history, and automated incident response playbooks that provide engineers with immediate, actionable intelligence.
