### CloudStrike AI: The AI-Powered Threat Sandbox

**The Problem:**
Cybersecurity teams struggle to prepare for threats they've never seen. Traditional security tools are reactive, and manual penetration testing is slow and expensive. How can teams proactively and safely test their defenses against the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud-native attacks?

**Our Solution:**
CloudStrike AI is a web-based threat modeling sandbox that uses a multi-agent AI to dynamically model attack scenarios from a single user prompt. Instead of relying on static mock data, it generates a complete and interconnected dataset for a truly dynamic analysis.

Key AI-driven features:
1.  **Attack Generation:** Translates natural language descriptions into realistic but safe attack scripts.
2.  **Impact Modeling:** Analyzes a script to generate a rich dataset of security events, dashboard metrics, and affected cloud resources.
3.  **Proactive Defense Validation:** Autonomously creates a countermeasure, simulates an engagement to score its effectiveness, and then **iterates on the defense to improve it**.
4.  **Response Planning:** Generates actionable response plans for any security event on demand.

CloudStrike AI empowers security professionals to think like an attacker and safely test and improve their defenses against realistic, AI-driven threats, transforming security from a reactive to a proactive discipline.
