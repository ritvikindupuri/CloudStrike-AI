### NetGuard AI: The AI-Powered Threat Sandbox

**The Problem:**
Cybersecurity teams struggle to prepare for threats they've never seen. Traditional security tools are reactive, and manual penetration testing is slow and expensive. How can teams proactively and safely test their defenses against the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud-native attacks?

**Our Solution:**
NetGuard AI is a web-based threat modeling sandbox that brings the power of generative AI to cybersecurity training. Built with Next.js and Google's Genkit, NetGuard AI allows users to simulate and analyze complex attack scenarios in a controlled environment.

Users can describe an attack in natural language, and our AI engine will:
1.  Generate a realistic but *simulated* attack script.
2.  Model the full impact of the script, generating a rich dataset of security events, dashboard metrics, and affected cloud resources.
3.  Autonomously create a defensive countermeasure script.
4.  Pit the attack vs. the defense in a simulated engagement, providing an effectiveness score and a detailed interaction log.

NetGuard AI empowers security professionals to think like an attacker, test their response playbooks, and strengthen their defensesâ€”all within a dynamic, AI-driven sandbox. It transforms threat intelligence from a static report into an interactive, hands-on experience.
